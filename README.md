# 🧩 Puzzle Game

A drag-and-drop puzzle game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was created just for fun and learning, to explore DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic using JavaScript.

## 🔍 Overview

I built this project while following a YouTube tutorial to understand how puzzle games are structured.

I wrote the code myself, step by step, without directly copying — mainly to learn about:

- Creating and shuffling puzzle pieces dynamically
- Implementing drag-and-drop mechanics
- Tracking moves using JavaScript events

## ✨ Features

- 5×5 puzzle grid — 25 pieces shuffled randomly at the start
- Drag-and-drop swapping to arrange pieces back into order
- Move counter — displays the total number of turns taken
- Interactive UI with real-time updates
- No external libraries required — works in any modern browser

## 📂 Project Structure

```

├── index.html   # Game structure
├── style.css    # Styling for the board and puzzle pieces
├── index.js     # JavaScript logic for drag-and-drop and move counter
└── images/      # Puzzle images (1.jpg to 25.jpg + blank.jpg)

```

## 🚀 Installation / Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Make sure your puzzle images are placed in the `images/` folder.  
3. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.  
4. Drag and drop pieces to complete the puzzle — see how many moves it takes!

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Using JavaScript events (`dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`, etc.) for interactive elements  
- Generating elements dynamically using `document.createElement()`  
- Shuffling arrays to randomize puzzle pieces  
- Tracking user actions with counters in real-time
